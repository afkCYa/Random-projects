first add: cross me calculator (basic)

many versions went by

Only useable by command line interface (eclipse)

Currently should use MainCrossMe & refactCrossMe

Only displays if it's a full line, but will tell you if you cant fit anything

One day ill write out my update log, rn it's too self deprecating
